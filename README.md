This project is **@deprecated** in favor of [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava). It offers the same event-driven programming model as TinyBus, but it's more capable and offers better control of threading.

![tinybus][1]

TinyBus is the faster implementation of [Otto][2] event bus with additional features you missed.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/beworker/tinybus.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/beworker/tinybus)

TinyBus is
=======
 - tiny (~ 26K jar)
 - fast (optimized for startup and event dispatching)
 - well tested (> 90 junit tests)
 - annotation based (no requirements on method names, no interfaces to implement)

TinyBus API in a nutshell
=======
 - `@Subscribe` annotates event handler methods running in the main thread.
 - `@Subscribe(mode=Mode.Background)` annotates event handler methods running in a background thread.
 - `@Subscribe(mode=Mode.Background, queue="web")` annotates event handler methods running in a serialized background queue with given name. You can have as many queues as you want.
 - `@Produce` annotates methods returning most recent events (aka sticky events).
 - `Bus.register(Object)` and `Bus.unregister(Object)` register and unregister objects with annotated subscriber and producer methods.
 - `Bus.hasRegistered(Object)` checks, whether given object is already registered.
 - `Bus.post(Object)` posts given event object to all registered subscribers.
 - `Bus.postDelayed(Object, long)` and `Bus.cancelDelayed(Class)` schedules single event delivery for later in time and cancels it.

For a more detailed example check out [Getting started][4] step-by-step guide or example application.

Performance reference tests
=======
![tinybus][3]

Executed on Nexus 5 device (Android 5.0.1, ART, screen off).

TinyBus extensions (still in 'Î²')
=======

Extensions is a unique feature of TinyBus. With it you can easily subscribe to commonly used events like battery level, connectivity change, phone shake event or even standard Android broadcast Intents. Here is a short example.

```java
public class MainActivity extends Activity {
    private TinyBus mBus;
        
    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
        
        // get bus instance 
        mBus = TinyBus.from(this)
        
        if (savedInstanceState == null) {
            // Note: ShakeEventWire stays wired when activity is re-created
            //       on configuration change. That's why we register is 
            //       only once inside if-statement.

            // wire device shake event provider
            mBus.wire(new ShakeEventWire());
        }
    }
    
    @Override
    protected void onStart() {
        super.onStart();
	    mBus.register(this);
	}
	
    @Override
    protected void onStop() {
        mBus.unregister(this);
        super.onStop();
    }
    
    @Subscribe
    public void onShakeEvent(ShakeEvent event) {
        // device has been shaken
    }
}
```
More detailed usage example can be found in example application.

Gradle dependencies
=======

For pure event bus implementation
```
dependencies {
    compile 'de.halfbit:tinybus:3.0.2'
}
```
For event bus with extensions
```
dependencies {
    compile 'de.halfbit:tinybus:3.0.2'
    compile 'de.halfbit:tinybus-extensions:3.0.2'
}
```

ProGuard configuration
=======

If you use Gradle build, then you don't need to configure anything, because it will use proper configuration already delivered with Android library archive. Otherwise you can use the configuration below:
```
-keepclassmembers, allowobfuscation class ** {
    @de.halfbit.tinybus.Subscribe public *;
    @de.halfbit.tinybus.Produce public *;
}
```
